# reading-list

This repository exists because I decided I want to read more books. The problem is, I didn't know what to read. I could read stuff I thought looked good, but that kept me reading the same kind of stuff over and over, so I asked friends, got a Goodreads account, and I got some recommendations, but not enough. So I finally decided to make this repo. The rules are simple:


 - The Issues tab keeps a list of books I should read. **If you think I should read a book, open an issue for it, and I will read it (probably)**.
 - When I'm reading a book, it'll be assigned to me [here's the list of books I'm currently reading](https://github.com/keithamus/reading-list/issues/assigned/keithamus)
 - When I've read a book, I'll close the issue [here's the list of books I've read (since 2018 when I opened this repo)](https://github.com/keithamus/reading-list/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
 - I might even comment on an issue with notes about a book
 - If you have questions about a book I've read, or am reading, or want to tell me something cool about a book I'm about to read, feel free to comment on it! If you spoil a book for me, I'll be sad and probably won't talk to you again. Not much fun there.
 - If you like to see boards of things, [check out the Reading board which shows books as little cards moving along the columns to be read](https://github.com/keithamus/reading-list/projects/1)
