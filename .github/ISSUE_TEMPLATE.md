<!--- 📖 Thanks for recommending a book 😄 --!!>

Please fill the subject line in with title of the book, and in brackets the author, like this:

 War and Peace (Leo Tolstoy)

Before you submit, maybe search open/closed my list to see if I've already got this in the list!

Maybe you could write below should tell me why I should read a book! It might make me read it faster 💨🏎️-->
